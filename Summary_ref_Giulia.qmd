## Summary
In this practical session we:
•	Processed bam files with metaDMG to generate taxonomic profiles and damage estimates from a metagenomic dataset
•	Investigated some primary statistics of the metaDMG output using R: deamination patterns, the amplitude of damage vs significance, the amplitude of damage and mean fragment length through time.

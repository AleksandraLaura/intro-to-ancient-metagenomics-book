## Abstract

_De novo_ assembly of ancient metagenomic samples enables the recovery of the genetic information of organisms without requiring any prior knowledge about their genomes. Therefore, this approach is very well suited to study the biological diversity of species that have not been studied well or are simply not known yet.

In this session, we will show you how to prepare your sequencing data and subsequently _de novo_ assemble them. Furthermore, we will then learn how we can actually evaluate what organisms we might have assembled and whether we obtained enough data to reconstruct a whole metagenome-assembled genome. We will particularly focus on the quality assessment of these reconstructed genomes and how we can ensure that we obtained high-quality genomes.

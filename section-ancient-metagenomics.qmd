title: Ancient Metagenomics
---

The techniques in this section of the book can be used in a variety of stages of any ancient metagenomics projects, for screening for pathogens (what species should I target for downstream genomic mapping?), for differential abundance analysis (does the community make of this sample change between different cultural periods?), but also for reference-free assembly of genomes (can I recover the genome architecture of a variety of species in my sample?). It focuses on the concept of 'many samples to many genomes' using high-throughput techniques and algorithms and trying to analyse data at whole 'community' levels.

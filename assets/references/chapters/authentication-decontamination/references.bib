abstract = "Analysis of microbial data from archaeological samples is a
            rapidly growing field with a great potential for understanding
            ancient environments, lifestyles and disease spread in the past.
            However, high error rates have been a long-standing challenge in
            ancient metagenomics analysis. This is also complicated by a
            limited choice of ancient microbiome specific computational
            frameworks that meet the growing computational demands of the
            field. Here, we propose aMeta, an accurate ancient Metagenomic
            profiling workflow designed primarily to minimize the amount of
            false discoveries and computer memory requirements. Using
            simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against
            a current state-of-the-art workflow, and demonstrate its superior
            sensitivity and specificity in both microbial detection and
            authentication, as well as substantially lower usage of computer
            memory. aMeta is implemented as a Snakemake workflow to facilitate
            use and reproducibility. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

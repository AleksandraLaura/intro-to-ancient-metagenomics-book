abstract  = "The rapid growth of high-throughput technologies has transformed
             biomedical research. With the increasing amount and complexity of
             data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not
             just for experiments, but also for computational analysis.
             However, transforming data into information involves running a
             large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating
             dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were
             developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline
             development, optimize resource usage, handle software
             installation and versions, and run on different compute
             platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this
             Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers,
             compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows,
             and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users.
             We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable
             novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice
             analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum,
             we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making
             computational analysis in biomedical research shareable,
             scalable, and reproducible.",

             heterogeneous landscape, we present an advanced, and entirely
             redesigned and extended version of the EAGER pipeline for the
             analysis of ancient genomic data. This Nextflow pipeline aims to
             address three main themes: accessibility and adaptability to
             different computing configurations, reproducibility to ensure
             robust analytical standards, and updating the pipeline to the
             latest routine ancient genomic practices. The new version of
             EAGER has been developed within the nf-core initiative to ensure
             high-quality software development and maintenance support;
             contributing to a long-term life-cycle for the pipeline.
             nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that a wider range of
             ancient DNA analyses can be applied by a diverse range of
             research groups and fields.",

            rapidly growing field with a great potential for understanding
            ancient environments, lifestyles and disease spread in the past.
            However, high error rates have been a long-standing challenge in
            ancient metagenomics analysis. This is also complicated by a
            limited choice of ancient microbiome specific computational
            frameworks that meet the growing computational demands of the
            field. Here, we propose aMeta, an accurate ancient Metagenomic
            profiling workflow designed primarily to minimize the amount of
            false discoveries and computer memory requirements. Using
            simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against
            a current state-of-the-art workflow, and demonstrate its superior
            sensitivity and specificity in both microbial detection and
            authentication, as well as substantially lower usage of computer
            memory. aMeta is implemented as a Snakemake workflow to facilitate
            use and reproducibility. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

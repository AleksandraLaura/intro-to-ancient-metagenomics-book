              expected from fresh muscle, and that the DNA was of relatively
              low molecular weight. Among the many clones obtained from the
              quagga DNA, two containing pieces of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
              were sequenced. These sequences, comprising 229 nucleotide pairs,
              differ by 12 base substitutions from the corresponding sequences
              of mtDNA from a mountain zebra, an extant member of the genus
              Equus. The number, nature and locations of the substitutions

               mineralized form of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that

               calcification of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that forms
               naturally on the surface of teeth. Dental calculus is ubiquitous
               in the archaeological record, found in all areas of the world
               and in populations from all time periods. Because multiple types
               of biomolecules and micro-remains are preserved over long time
               periods in dental calculus, studies of dental calculus have many
               different applications. This chapter discusses how studies of
               dental calculus have been used to investigate the oral
               microbiome, the host, diet, and craft activities in the past. In
               addition to genetic studies of the oral microbiome, proteins and

              Comparative genomics of modern isolates suggests that M.

              recorded and most stigmatizing diseases in human history. The
              disease was prevalent in Europe until the 16th century and is
              still endemic in many countries with over 200,000 new cases

              European medieval M. leprae genomes revealed that they cluster
              into several distinct branches of which two were present in
              medieval Northwestern Europe. In this study, we analyzed 10 new
              medieval M. leprae genomes including the so far oldest M. leprae
              genome from one of the earliest known cases of leprosy in the
              United Kingdom-a skeleton from the Great Chesterford cemetery
              with a calibrated age of 415-545 C.E. This dataset provides a
              genetic time transect of M. leprae diversity in Europe over the
              past 1500 years. We find M. leprae strains from four distinct

              The resulting more complex picture of the past phylogeography of

              even an origin in Western Eurasia. Furthermore, these results

              with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut
              origin, 39\% represent previously undescribed species-level
              genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification

              to evaluate the responses of aquatic microbes in the past and
              make predictions about future biodiversity change in those

              to the analysis of historically deposited DNA in sediments have
              not only allowed the taxonomic identification of past aquatic
              microbial communities but also enabled tracing their evolution

               investigating past marine ecosystems---from the smallest
               bacteria to phytoplankton and their predators--- over geological
               timescales. Knowledge about such paleo-food webs can provide
               broad-scale biological context to paleoceanographic and
               environmental reconstructions. However, the field of marine
               sedaDNA research is still in its infancy; community
               reconstructions are complicated by the minuscule amounts of
               ancient DNA preserved in the sediments. Consequently, the
               identification of most prokaryotes and eukaryotes in sedaDNA is
               difficult, and sedaDNA sampling, extraction, and analysis
               require optimized procedures and rigorous contamination control
               to ensure that the sedaDNA signal is authentic and not
               overridden by modern environmental DNA. This article describes
               some of the latest developments in marine sedaDNA research,
               including the use of metagenomics to study past marine food
               webs, and new experimental and computational techniques to

               An example of bioinformatic techniques designed to increase

               paleogenetic signals that could be extracted from marine

              with likely dormant methanogens from the permafrost's seed bank.
              Our findings reveal that at the time of the formation, the
              terrestrial input of the Kap K{\o}benhavn site originated from a
              palustrine wetland, suggesting non-permafrost conditions. During
              this time, detection of methanogenic archaea and carbon
              processing pathways suggests a moderate strengthening of methane
              emissions through the northward expansion of wetlands.
              Intriguingly, we discover a remarkable sequence similarity
              (>98\%) between pioneer methanogens and present-day thawing

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The terrestrial subsurface is home to a significant
              proportion of the Earth's microbial biomass. Our understanding
              about terrestrial subsurface microbiomes is almost exclusively
              derived from groundwater and porous sediments mainly by using 16S
              rRNA gene surveys. To obtain more insights about biomass of
              consolidated rocks and the metabolic status of endolithic
              microbiomes, we investigated interbedded limestone and mudstone
              from the vadose zone, fractured aquifers, and deep aquitards.
              RESULTS: By adapting methods from microbial archaeology and
              paleogenomics, we could recover sufficient DNA for downstream
              metagenomic analysis from seven rock specimens independent of
              porosity, lithology, and depth. Based on the extracted DNA, we
              estimated between 2.81 and 4.25 $\times$ 105 cells $\times$ g-1
              rock. Analyzing DNA damage patterns revealed paleome signatures
              (genetic records of past microbial communities) for three rock
              specimens, all obtained from the vadose zone. DNA obtained from
              deep aquitards isolated from surface input was not affected by
              DNA decay indicating that water saturation and not flow is
              controlling subsurface microbial survival. Decoding the taxonomy
              and functional potential of paleome communities revealed
              increased abundances for sequences affiliated with
              chemolithoautotrophs and taxa such as Cand. Rokubacteria. We also
              found a broader metabolic potential in terms of aromatic
              hydrocarbon breakdown, suggesting a preferred utilization of
              sedimentary organic matter in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
              suggests that limestones function as archives for genetic records
              of past microbial communities including those sensitive to
              environmental stress at modern times, due to their specific

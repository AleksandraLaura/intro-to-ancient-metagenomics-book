  abstract = "To determine whether DNA survives and can be recovered from the
              remains of extinct creatures, we have examined dried muscle from
              a museum specimen of the quagga, a zebra-like species (Equus
              quagga) that became extinct in 1883 (ref. 1). We report that DNA
              was extracted from this tissue in amounts approaching 1\% of that
              expected from fresh muscle, and that the DNA was of relatively
              low molecular weight. Among the many clones obtained from the
              quagga DNA, two containing pieces of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
              were sequenced. These sequences, comprising 229 nucleotide pairs,
              differ by 12 base substitutions from the corresponding sequences
              of mtDNA from a mountain zebra, an extant member of the genus
              Equus. The number, nature and locations of the substitutions
              imply that there has been little or no postmortem modification of
              the quagga DNA sequences, and that the two species had a common
              ancestor 3-4 Myr ago, consistent with fossil evidence concerning
              the age of the genus Equus.",

  abstract = "A new method for determining nucleotide sequences in DNA is
              described. It is similar to the ``plus and minus'' method

              but makes use of the 2',3'-dideoxy and arabinonucleoside
              analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which act
              as specific chain-terminating inhibitors of DNA polymerase. The
              technique has been applied to the DNA of bacteriophage varphiX174
              and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the
              minus method.",

              expected from fresh muscle, and that the DNA was of relatively
              low molecular weight. Among the many clones obtained from the
              quagga DNA, two containing pieces of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
              were sequenced. These sequences, comprising 229 nucleotide pairs,
              differ by 12 base substitutions from the corresponding sequences
              of mtDNA from a mountain zebra, an extant member of the genus
              Equus. The number, nature and locations of the substitutions

               mineralized form of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that

               calcification of dental plaque, a bacterial biofilm that forms
               naturally on the surface of teeth. Dental calculus is ubiquitous
               in the archaeological record, found in all areas of the world
               and in populations from all time periods. Because multiple types
               of biomolecules and micro-remains are preserved over long time
               periods in dental calculus, studies of dental calculus have many
               different applications. This chapter discusses how studies of
               dental calculus have been used to investigate the oral
               microbiome, the host, diet, and craft activities in the past. In
               addition to genetic studies of the oral microbiome, proteins and

              Comparative genomics of modern isolates suggests that M.

              recorded and most stigmatizing diseases in human history. The
              disease was prevalent in Europe until the 16th century and is
              still endemic in many countries with over 200,000 new cases

              European medieval M. leprae genomes revealed that they cluster
              into several distinct branches of which two were present in
              medieval Northwestern Europe. In this study, we analyzed 10 new
              medieval M. leprae genomes including the so far oldest M. leprae
              genome from one of the earliest known cases of leprosy in the
              United Kingdom-a skeleton from the Great Chesterford cemetery
              with a calibrated age of 415-545 C.E. This dataset provides a
              genetic time transect of M. leprae diversity in Europe over the
              past 1500 years. We find M. leprae strains from four distinct

              even an origin in Western Eurasia. Furthermore, these results

               investigating past marine ecosystems---from the smallest
               bacteria to phytoplankton and their predators--- over geological
               timescales. Knowledge about such paleo-food webs can provide
               broad-scale biological context to paleoceanographic and
               environmental reconstructions. However, the field of marine
               sedaDNA research is still in its infancy; community
               reconstructions are complicated by the minuscule amounts of
               ancient DNA preserved in the sediments. Consequently, the
               identification of most prokaryotes and eukaryotes in sedaDNA is
               difficult, and sedaDNA sampling, extraction, and analysis
               require optimized procedures and rigorous contamination control
               to ensure that the sedaDNA signal is authentic and not
               overridden by modern environmental DNA. This article describes
               some of the latest developments in marine sedaDNA research,

              with likely dormant methanogens from the permafrost's seed bank.
              Our findings reveal that at the time of the formation, the
              terrestrial input of the Kap K{\o}benhavn site originated from a
              palustrine wetland, suggesting non-permafrost conditions. During

              proportion of the Earth's microbial biomass. Our understanding
              about terrestrial subsurface microbiomes is almost exclusively
              derived from groundwater and porous sediments mainly by using 16S
              rRNA gene surveys. To obtain more insights about biomass of
              consolidated rocks and the metabolic status of endolithic
              microbiomes, we investigated interbedded limestone and mudstone
              from the vadose zone, fractured aquifers, and deep aquitards.
              RESULTS: By adapting methods from microbial archaeology and
              paleogenomics, we could recover sufficient DNA for downstream
              metagenomic analysis from seven rock specimens independent of
              porosity, lithology, and depth. Based on the extracted DNA, we
              estimated between 2.81 and 4.25 $\times$ 105 cells $\times$ g-1
              rock. Analyzing DNA damage patterns revealed paleome signatures
              (genetic records of past microbial communities) for three rock
              specimens, all obtained from the vadose zone. DNA obtained from
              deep aquitards isolated from surface input was not affected by
              DNA decay indicating that water saturation and not flow is
              controlling subsurface microbial survival. Decoding the taxonomy
              and functional potential of paleome communities revealed
              increased abundances for sequences affiliated with
              chemolithoautotrophs and taxa such as Cand. Rokubacteria. We also
              found a broader metabolic potential in terms of aromatic
              hydrocarbon breakdown, suggesting a preferred utilization of
              sedimentary organic matter in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
              suggests that limestones function as archives for genetic records

              environmental stress at modern times, due to their specific

              Peruvian human skeletons, revealing that a member of the M.
              tuberculosis complex caused human disease before contact. The
              ancient strains are distinct from known human-adapted forms and
              are most closely related to those adapted to seals and sea lions.
              Two independent dating approaches suggest a most recent common
              ancestor for the M. tuberculosis complex less than 6,000 years
              ago, which supports a Holocene dispersal of the disease. Our

              understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral
              microbiome, we analyzed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from
              humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to
              present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as
              New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core
              microbiome of primarily biofilm structural taxa has been
              maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these
              microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting
              that they have been important oral members since before the

              structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely

              differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes from up to 100

  abstract = "Fifty years ago, David Baltimore published a brief conceptual
              paper delineating the classification of viruses by the routes of
              genome expression. The six ``Baltimore classes'' of viruses, with
              a subsequently added 7th class, became the conceptual framework
              for the development of virology during the next five decades.
              During this time, it became clear that the Baltimore classes,
              with relatively minor additions, indeed cover the diversity of
              virus genome expression schemes that also define the replication
              cycles. Here, we examine the status of the Baltimore classes 50
              years after their advent and explore their links with the global
              ecology and biology of the respective viruses. We discuss an
              extension of the Baltimore scheme and why many logically
              admissible expression-replication schemes do not appear to be
              realized in nature. Recent phylogenomic analyses allow tracing
              the complex connections between the Baltimore classes and the
              monophyletic realms of viruses. The five classes of RNA viruses
              and reverse-transcribing viruses share an origin, whereas both
              the single-stranded DNA viruses and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
              viruses evolved on multiple independent occasions. Most of the
              Baltimore classes of viruses probably emerged during the earliest
              era of life evolution, at the stage of the primordial pool of
              diverse replicators, and before the advent of modern-like cells
              with large dsDNA genomes. The Baltimore classes remain an
              integral part of the conceptual foundation of biology, providing
              the essential structure for the logical space of information

  abstract = "The genome architecture of bacteria and eukaryotes evolves in
              opposite directions when subject to genetic drift, a difference
              that can be ascribed to the fact that bacteria exhibit a
              mutational bias that deletes superfluous sequences, whereas
              eukaryotes are biased toward large insertions. Expansion of
              eukaryotic genomes occurs through the addition of non-functional
              sequences, such as repetitive sequences and transposable
              elements, whereas variation in bacterial genome size is largely
              due to the acquisition and loss of functional accessory genes.
              These properties create the situation in which eukaryotes with
              very similar numbers of genes can have vastly different genome
              sizes, while in bacteria, gene number scales linearly with genome
              size. Some bacterial genomes, however, particularly those of
              species that undergo bottlenecks due to recent association with
              hosts, accumulate pseudogenes and mobile elements, conferring
              them a low gene content relative to their genome size. These
              non-functional sequences are gradually eroded and eliminated
              after long-term association with hosts, with the result that
              obligate symbionts have the smallest genomes of any cellular
              organism. The architecture of bacterial genomes is shaped by
              complex and diverse processes, but for most bacterial species,
              genome size is governed by a non-adaptive process, i.e., genetic
              drift coupled with a mutational bias toward deletions. Thus,
              bacteria with small effective population sizes typically have the
              smallest genomes. Some marine bacteria counter this
              near-universal trend: despite having immense population sizes,
              selection, not drift, acts to reduce genome size in response to
              metabolic constraints in their nutrient-limited environment.",

              thoughts about the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic
              cells. More than 20 different versions of endosymbiotic theory
              have been presented in the literature to explain the origin of
              eukaryotes and their mitochondria. Very few of those models
              account for eukaryotic anaerobes. The role of energy and the
              energetic constraints that prokaryotic cell organization placed
              on evolutionary innovation in cell history has recently come to
              bear on endosymbiotic theory. Only cells that possessed

              complexity, which is why there are no true intermediates in the
              prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition. Current versions of

              prominent constituents of prokaryotic genomes. Many plasmids are
              found in their host cell in multiple copies. This leads to an
              increased mutational supply of plasmid-encoded genes and
              genetically heterogeneous plasmid genomes. Nonetheless, the
              segregation of plasmid copies into daughter cells during cell
              division is considered to occur in the absence of selection on
              the plasmid alleles. We investigate the implications of random
              genetic drift of multicopy plasmids during cell division-termed
              here ``segregational drift''-to plasmid evolution. Performing
              experimental evolution of low- and high-copy non-mobile plasmids
              in Escherichia coli, we find that the evolutionary rate of
              multicopy plasmids does not reflect the increased mutational
              supply expected according to their copy number. In addition,
              simulated evolution of multicopy plasmid alleles demonstrates
              that segregational drift leads to increased loss frequency and
              extended fixation time of plasmid mutations in comparison to

              demonstrates that segregational drift of multicopy plasmids
              interferes with the retention and fixation of novel plasmid
              variants. Depending on the selection pressure on newly emerging
              variants, plasmid genomes may evolve slower than haploid
              chromosomes, regardless of their higher mutational supply. We
              suggest that plasmid copy number is an important determinant of

  abstract = "Genome size in mammals and birds shows remarkably little
              interspecific variation compared with other taxa. However, genome
              sequencing has revealed that many mammal and bird lineages have
              experienced differential rates of transposable element (TE)
              accumulation, which would be predicted to cause substantial
              variation in genome size between species. Thus, we hypothesize
              that there has been covariation between the amount of DNA gained
              by transposition and lost by deletion during mammal and avian
              evolution, resulting in genome size equilibrium. To test this
              model, we develop computational methods to quantify the amount of
              DNA gained by TE expansion and lost by deletion over the last 100
              My in the lineages of 10 species of eutherian mammals and 24
              species of birds. The results reveal extensive variation in the
              amount of DNA gained via lineage-specific transposition, but that
              DNA loss counteracted this expansion to various extents across
              lineages. Our analysis of the rate and size spectrum of deletion
              events implies that DNA removal in both mammals and birds has
              proceeded mostly through large segmental deletions (>10 kb).
              These findings support a unified ``accordion'' model of genome
              size evolution in eukaryotes whereby DNA loss counteracting TE
              expansion is a major determinant of genome size. Furthermore, we
              propose that extensive DNA loss, and not necessarily a dearth of
              TE activity, has been the primary force maintaining the greater
              genomic compaction of flying birds and bats relative to their

              obesity through continual DNA bloating, recent research supports
              that most plants activity purge DNA. Plant genome size research
              has greatly benefited from the cataloguing of genome size
              estimates at the Kew Plant DNA C-values Database, and the recent
              availability of over 50 fully sequenced and published plant
              genomes. The emerging trend is that plant genomes bloat due to
              the copy-and-paste proliferation of a few long terminal repeat
              retrotransposons (LTRs) and aggressively purge these
              proliferating LTRs through several mechanisms including
              illegitimate and incomplete recombination, and double-strand
              break repair through non-homologous end joining. However,
              ultra-small genomes such as Utricularia gibba (Bladderwort),
              which is 82 megabases (Mb), purge excess DNA through genome
              fractionation and neofunctionalization during multiple rounds of
              whole genome duplication (WGD). In contrast, the largest
              published genome, Picea abies (Norway Spruce) at 19 800 Mb, has
              no detectable WGD but has bloated with diverse and diverged LTRs
              that either have evaded purging mechanisms or these purging
              mechanism are absent in gymnosperms. Finally, advances in DNA
              methylation studies suggest that smaller genomes have a more
              aggressive epigenomic surveillance system to purge young LTR
              retrotransposons, which is less active or missing in larger
              genomes like the bloated gymnosperms. While genome size may not

              Discovery of examples of genome dynamism is accelerating as
              genome sequences are completed from diverse eukaryotes. Though
              much is known about genomes in animals, fungi, and plants, these
              lineages represent only 3 of the 60-200 lineages of eukaryotes.
              Here, we discuss diverse genomic strategies in exemplar
              eukaryotic lineages, including numerous microbial eukaryotes, to
              reveal dramatic variation that challenges established views of
              genome evolution. For example, in the life cycle of some members
              of the ``radiolaria,'' ploidy increases from haploid (N) to
              approximately 1,000N, whereas intrapopulation variability of the
              enteric parasite Entamoeba ranges from 4N to 40N. Variation has
              also been found within our own species, with substantial
              differences in both gene content and chromosome lengths between
              individuals. Data on the dynamic nature of genomes shift the
              perception of the genome from being fixed and characteristic of a

              caused by Mycobacterium leprae, but a small number of cases are
              now known to be caused by Mycobacterium lepromatosis, a sister
              taxon of M. leprae. The global pattern of genomic variation in M.

              being sequenced, such as the presence of blunt ends,
              single-stranded overhangs, or single-strand breaks. We here
              describe MatchSeq, a method that combines single-stranded DNA
              library preparation from diluted DNA samples with computational
              sequence matching, allowing the reconstruction of double-stranded
              DNA fragments on a single-molecule level. The application of
              MatchSeq to Neanderthal DNA, a particularly complex source of
              degraded DNA, reveals that 1- or 2-nt overhangs and blunt ends
              dominate the ends of ancient DNA molecules and that short gaps
              exist, which are predominantly caused by the loss of individual
              purines. We further show that deamination of cytosine to uracil
              occurs in both single- and double-stranded contexts close to the
              ends of molecules, and that single-stranded parts of DNA

              samples for sequencing have hitherto made it impossible to
              determine the precise structure of double-stranded DNA fragments
              being sequenced, such as the presence of blunt ends,
              single-stranded overhangs, or single-strand breaks. We here
              describe MatchSeq, a method that combines single-stranded DNA
              library preparation from diluted DNA samples with computational
              sequence matching, allowing the reconstruction of double-stranded
              DNA fragments on a single-molecule level. The application of
              MatchSeq to Neanderthal DNA, a particularly complex source of
              degraded DNA, reveals that 1- or 2-nt overhangs and blunt ends
              dominate the ends of ancient DNA molecules and that short gaps
              exist, which are predominantly caused by the loss of individual
              purines. We further show that deamination of cytosine to uracil
              occurs in both single- and double-stranded contexts close to the
              ends of molecules, and that single-stranded parts of DNA
              fragments are enriched in pyrimidines. MatchSeq provides
              unprecedented resolution for interrogating the structures of
              fragmented double-stranded DNA and can be applied to fragmented
              double-stranded DNA isolated from any biological source. The
              method relies on well-established laboratory techniques and can
              easily be integrated into routine data generation. This
              possibility is shown by the successful reconstruction of
              double-stranded DNA fragments from previously published
              single-stranded sequence data, allowing a more comprehensive
              characterization of the biochemical properties not only of

              been determined. Incubation of M13mp2 nicked heteroduplex DNA
              molecules containing T.C or C.C mispairs in the lacZ
              alpha-complementation gene results in deamination of cytosine to
              uracil, producing T.U or C.U mispairs. Strands which have
              undergone deamination at the target site to produce uracil will
              yield dark blue plaque revertants, while all other strands yield
              faint blue or colorless plaque phenotypes upon transfection of an
              ung- alpha-complementation Escherichia coli host strain. Rate
              constants were calculated from the reversion frequencies for
              several different heteroduplexes incubated at either 60 or 37
              degrees C. For the 60 degrees C incubations, the hydrolytic
              deamination rate constants for mispairs in three different local
              sequence environments ranged from 8 x 10(-10) to 40 x 10(-10)
              s-1. For incubations at 37 degrees C, the rate constants were
              between 0.4 x 10(-10) and 1.3 x 10(-10) sec-1. At both
              temperatures and for all mispairs, these rate constants are
              significantly greater than deamination rate constants in properly
              matched Watson-Crick G.C base pairs and are similar to those
              constants determined for cytosine deamination in single-stranded
              DNA. Since deamination most likely occurs via a single-stranded
              intermediate, the data suggest that, at 37 degrees C, the T.C and
              C.C mispairs exhibit from 20\% to 100\% single-stranded
              character. We conclude that cytosine residues involved in a
              mispair in DNA are 1-2 orders of magnitude more prone to
              deaminate to uracil than are cytosines in double-stranded
              DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

               ancient DNA extracts. The characterization of this additional

               restriction, and other stress conditions, including
               sociocultural changes. At the population level, they can

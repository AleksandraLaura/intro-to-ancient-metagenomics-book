  abstract  = {The rapid growth of high-throughput technologies has transformed
               biomedical research. With the increasing amount and complexity of
               data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not
               just for experiments, but also for computational analysis.
               However, transforming data into information involves running a
               large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating
               dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were
               developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline
               development, optimize resource usage, handle software
               installation and versions, and run on different compute
               platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this
               Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers,
               compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows,
               and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users.
               We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable
               novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice
               analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum,
               we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making
               computational analysis in biomedical research shareable,
               scalable, and reproducible.},

              However, high error rates have been a long-standing challenge in
              ancient metagenomics analysis. This is also complicated by a
              limited choice of ancient microbiome specific computational

              simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against
              a current state-of-the-art workflow, and demonstrate its superior
              sensitivity and specificity in both microbial detection and

               outbreaks throughout human history, and ancient DNA evidence has
               shown it afflicted human populations as far back as the
               Neolithic. Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Eurasian Late
               Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period have uncovered key
               evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia
               pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor; however, the number of
               reconstructed LNBA genomes are too few to explore its diversity
               during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17
               Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide
               geographic expanse across Eurasia. This increased dataset enabled
               us to explore correlations between temporal, geographical, and
               genetic distance. Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and
               potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia
               without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by
               rapid dispersal across continents throughout this period, a trend
               not observed in other pathogens for which ancient genomes are
               available. A stepwise pattern of gene loss provides further clues
               on its early evolution and potential adaptation. We also discover
               the presence of the flea-adapted form of Y. pestis in Bronze Age
               Iberia, previously only identified in in the Caucasus and the
               Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this
               form of Y. pestis. Together, these data reveal the dynamic nature

               critical for several key applications, yet many tools available
               require large computational power and are often prone to false
               positive identifications. Here we describe High-AccuracY and
               Scalable Taxonomic Assignment of MetagenomiC data (HAYSTAC),
               which can estimate the probability that a specific taxon is
               present in a metagenome. HAYSTAC provides a user-friendly tool to
               construct databases, based on publicly available genomes, that
               are used for competitive read mapping. It then uses a novel
               Bayesian framework to infer the abundance and statistical support
               for each species identification and provide per-read species
               classification. Unlike other methods, HAYSTAC is specifically
               designed to efficiently handle both ancient and modern DNA data,
               as well as incomplete reference databases, making it possible to
               run highly accurate hypothesis-driven analyses (i.e., assessing
               the presence of a specific species) on variably sized reference
               databases while dramatically improving processing speeds. We
               tested the performance and accuracy of HAYSTAC using simulated
               Illumina libraries, both with and without ancient DNA damage, and
               compared the results to other currently available methods (i.e.,
               Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq, MALT/HOPS, and Sigma). HAYSTAC
               identified fewer false positives than both Kraken2/Bracken,
               KrakenUniq and MALT in all simulations, and fewer than Sigma in
               simulations of ancient data. It uses less memory than
               Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq as well as MALT both during database
               construction and sample analysis. Lastly, we used HAYSTAC to
               search for specific pathogens in two published ancient
               metagenomic datasets, demonstrating how it can be applied to
               empirical datasets. HAYSTAC is available from

  abstract = {Micro-organisms account for most of the Earth's biodiversity and
              yet remain largely unknown. The complexity and diversity of
              microbial communities present in clinical and environmental
              samples can now be robustly investigated in record times and
              prices thanks to recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing
              (HTS). Here, we develop metaBIT, an open-source computational
              pipeline automatizing routine microbial profiling of shotgun HTS
              data. Customizable by the user at different stringency levels, it
              performs robust taxonomy-based assignment and relative abundance
              calculation of microbial taxa, as well as cross-sample statistical
              analyses of microbial diversity distributions. We demonstrate the
              versatility of metaBIT within a range of published HTS data sets
              sampled from the environment (soil and seawater) and the human
              body (skin and gut), but also from archaeological specimens. We
              present the diversity of outputs provided by the pipeline for the
              visualization of microbial profiles (barplots, heatmaps) and for
              their characterization and comparison (diversity indices,
              hierarchical clustering and principal coordinates analyses). We
              show that metaBIT allows an automatic, fast and user-friendly
              profiling of the microbial DNA present in HTS shotgun data sets.
              The applications of metaBIT are vast, from monitoring of
              laboratory errors and contaminations, to the reconstruction of
              past and present microbiota, and the detection of candidate
              species, including pathogens.},

              However, this requires the processing of vast amounts of data and
              involves a large number of steps that use a variety of
              computational tools. Here we present PALEOMIX
              (http://geogenetics.ku.dk/publications/paleomix), a flexible and
              user-friendly pipeline applicable to both modern and ancient
              genomes, which largely automates the in silico analyses behind
              whole-genome resequencing. Starting with next-generation
              sequencing reads, PALEOMIX carries out adapter removal, mapping
              against reference genomes, PCR duplicate removal, characterization
              of and compensation for postmortem damage, SNP calling and
              maximum-likelihood phylogenomic inference, and it profiles the
              metagenomic contents of the samples. As such, PALEOMIX allows for
              a series of potential applications in paleogenomics, comparative
              genomics and metagenomics. Applying the PALEOMIX pipeline to the
              three ancient and seven modern Phytophthora infestans genomes as
              described here takes 5 d using a 16-core server.},

               manager Snakemake and is optimized for low-space consumption,
               allowing to efficiently (re)map large datasets-such as reference
               panels and multiple extracts and libraries per sample - to one or
               several genomes. Mapache can easily be customized or combined
               with other Snakemake tools. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
               Mapache is freely available on GitHub
               (https://github.com/sneuensc/mapache). An extensive manual is
               provided at https://github.com/sneuensc/mapache/wiki.

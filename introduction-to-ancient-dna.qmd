## Questions to think about

- What is ancient DNA?
- Where do we find ancient DNA from microbes?
- How does DNA degrade?
- How do I interpret a DNA damage plot?
- How is DNA damage used to authenticate ancient genomes and samples?
- What methods are available for managing DNA damage?
- How does DNA damage matter for my analyses?

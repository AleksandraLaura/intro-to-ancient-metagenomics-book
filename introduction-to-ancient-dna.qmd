The field of paleogenomics focuses on the study of ancient DNA, and traces its origins to the 1980s. 
This chapter provides a brief overview of the methodological history of the field and reviews the fundamentals of how ancient DNA is recovered, sequenced, and authenticated today. 
Emphasis is placed on how DNA degrades and how DNA degradation patterns are used to help authenticate ancient DNA at the level of sequences, genomes, and samples, as well as how DNA damage creates both opportunities and downstream challenges when genotyping or generating phylogenies.

              detecting low-frequency genetic variants that are important for
              cancer molecular diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance using deep
              next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, there is a lack of
              comprehensive understanding of errors introduced at various steps
              of a conventional NGS workflow, such as sample handling, library
              preparation, PCR enrichment, and sequencing. In this study, we use
              current NGS technology to systematically investigate these
              questions. RESULTS: By evaluating read-specific error
              distributions, we discover that the substitution error rate can be
              computationally suppressed to 10-5 to 10-4, which is 10- to
              100-fold lower than generally considered achievable (10-3) in the
              current literature. We then quantify substitution errors
              attributable to sample handling, library preparation, enrichment
              PCR, and sequencing by using multiple deep sequencing datasets. We
              find that error rates differ by nucleotide substitution types,
              ranging from 10-5 for A>C/T>G, C>A/G>T, and C>G/G>C changes to
              10-4 for A>G/T>C changes. Furthermore, C>T/G>A errors exhibit
              strong sequence context dependency, sample-specific effects
              dominate elevated C>A/G>T errors, and target-enrichment PCR led to
              ~ 6-fold increase of overall error rate. We also find that more
              than 70\% of hotspot variants can be detected at 0.1 ~ 0.01\%
              frequency with the current NGS technology by applying in silico
              error suppression. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first comprehensive
              analysis of sequencing error sources in conventional NGS
              workflows. The error profiles revealed by our study highlight new

              gigabases of sequencing output per run at a fraction of the time
              and cost of conventional technologies. The process typically
              involves four basic steps: library preparation, cluster
              generation, sequencing, and data analysis. In 2015, a new
              chemistry of cluster generation was introduced in the newer
              Illumina machines (HiSeq 3000/4000/X Ten) called exclusion
              amplification (ExAmp), which was a fundamental shift from the
              earlier method of random cluster generation by bridge
              amplification on a non-patterned flow cell. The ExAmp chemistry,
              in conjunction with patterned flow cells containing nanowells at
              fixed locations, increases cluster density on the flow cell,
              thereby reducing the cost per run. It also increases sequence read
              quality, especially for longer read lengths (up to 150 base
              pairs). This advance has been widely adopted for genome sequencing
              because greater sequencing depth can be achieved for lower cost
              without compromising the quality of longer reads. We show that
              this promising chemistry is problematic, however, when
              multiplexing samples. We discovered that up to 5-10\% of
              sequencing reads (or signals) are incorrectly assigned from a
              given sample to other samples in a multiplexed pool. We provide
              evidence that this “spreading-of-signals” arises from low levels
              of free index primers present in the pool. These index primers can
              prime pooled library fragments at random via complementary 3′
              ends, and get extended by DNA polymerase, creating a new library
              molecule with a new index before binding to the patterned flow
              cell to generate a cluster for sequencing. This causes the
              resulting read from that cluster to be assigned to a different
              sample, causing the spread of signals within multiplexed samples.
              We show that low levels of free index primers persist after the
              most common library purification procedure recommended by
              Illumina, and that the amount of signal spreading among samples is
              proportional to the level of free index primer present in the
              library pool. This artifact causes homogenization and
              misclassification of cells in single cell RNA-seq experiments.
              Therefore, all data generated in this way must now be carefully
              re-examined to ensure that “spreading-of-signals” has not
              compromised data analysis and conclusions. Re-sequencing samples
              using an older technology that uses conventional bridge
              amplification for cluster generation, or improved library cleanup
              strategies to remove free index primers, can minimize or eliminate
              this signal spreading artifact.",

              results in read misassignment (usually <1\%) across samples
              sequenced on the same lane. Alarmingly high rates of read
              misassignment of up to 10\% were reported for lllumina sequencing
              machines with exclusion amplification chemistry. This may make use
              of these platforms prohibitive, particularly in studies that rely
              on low-quantity and low-quality samples, such as historical and
              archaeological specimens. Here, we use barcodes, short sequences
              that are ligated to both ends of the DNA insert, to directly
              quantify the rate of index hopping in 100-year old

              for multiple sources of noise, we identify on average 0.470\% of

              samples with few sequenced reads receive the greatest proportion

              samples, as these frequently differ in their DNA quantity and

              3'-O-allyl-dNTPs-allyl-fluorophore in a polymerase reaction, are
              removed simultaneously in 30 s by Pd-catalyzed deallylation in

              chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers
              on ancient human DNA published between 1988 and 2013. The
              estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6\% ± 2.1\%)
              and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic
              research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a
              questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals'
              editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be
              simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests.
              Most data were made available through body text, but the use of
              primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction
              of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods.
              Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results
              imply that researchers' awareness of the importance of openness
              and transparency for scientific progress may complement
              stakeholders' policies in achieving very high sharing rates.
              Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with
              a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability,
              accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the
              different ways in which data are released can be very useful to
              detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and
              understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of
              human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the
              importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable
              scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental
              challenges.",

               critical for several key applications, yet many tools available

               positive identifications. Here we describe High-AccuracY and
               Scalable Taxonomic Assignment of MetagenomiC data (HAYSTAC),
               which can estimate the probability that a specific taxon is
               present in a metagenome. HAYSTAC provides a user-friendly tool to
               construct databases, based on publicly available genomes, that
               are used for competitive read mapping. It then uses a novel
               Bayesian framework to infer the abundance and statistical support
               for each species identification and provide per-read species
               classification. Unlike other methods, HAYSTAC is specifically
               designed to efficiently handle both ancient and modern DNA data,
               as well as incomplete reference databases, making it possible to
               run highly accurate hypothesis-driven analyses (i.e., assessing
               the presence of a specific species) on variably sized reference
               databases while dramatically improving processing speeds. We
               tested the performance and accuracy of HAYSTAC using simulated
               Illumina libraries, both with and without ancient DNA damage, and
               compared the results to other currently available methods (i.e.,
               Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq, MALT/HOPS, and Sigma). HAYSTAC
               identified fewer false positives than both Kraken2/Bracken,
               KrakenUniq and MALT in all simulations, and fewer than Sigma in
               simulations of ancient data. It uses less memory than
               Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq as well as MALT both during database
               construction and sample analysis. Lastly, we used HAYSTAC to
               search for specific pathogens in two published ancient
               metagenomic datasets, demonstrating how it can be applied to
               empirical datasets. HAYSTAC is available from

               data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not
               just for experiments, but also for computational analysis.
               However, transforming data into information involves running a
               large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating
               dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were

               installation and versions, and run on different compute
               platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this

               outbreaks throughout human history, and ancient DNA evidence has
               shown it afflicted human populations as far back as the
               Neolithic. Y. pestis genomes recovered from the Eurasian Late
               Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (LNBA) period have uncovered key
               evolutionary steps that led to its emergence from a Yersinia
               pseudotuberculosis-like progenitor; however, the number of
               reconstructed LNBA genomes are too few to explore its diversity
               during this critical period of development. Here, we present 17
               Y. pestis genomes dating to 5,000 to 2,500 y BP from a wide
               geographic expanse across Eurasia. This increased dataset enabled
               us to explore correlations between temporal, geographical, and
               genetic distance. Our results suggest a nonflea-adapted and
               potentially extinct single lineage that persisted over millennia
               without significant parallel diversification, accompanied by
               rapid dispersal across continents throughout this period, a trend
               not observed in other pathogens for which ancient genomes are
               available. A stepwise pattern of gene loss provides further clues
               on its early evolution and potential adaptation. We also discover
               the presence of the flea-adapted form of Y. pestis in Bronze Age
               Iberia, previously only identified in in the Caucasus and the
               Volga regions, suggesting a much wider geographic spread of this

For this chapter's exercises, if not already performed, you will need to create the [conda environment](before-you-start.qmd#creating-a-conda-environment) from the `yml` file in the following [link](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/intro-to-ancient-metagenomics-book/raw/main/assets/envs/bare-bones-bash.yml) (right click and save as to download), and once created, activate the environment with:

```bash
conda activate bare-bones-bash
```

## Lecture

This is the Brief version of a more Broad two-part session that we gave in 2022, which can be found [here](https://spaam-community.github.io/wss-summer-school/#/2022/day-1?id=practical-1b-bare-bones-bash-1).
The teaching material for the Boundless Bare Bones Bash (Basic + Boosted) can be found in the [Bare Bones Bash website](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/)

### tl;dr

Below is a quick reference guide to the commands discussed in this tutorial.
To understand actually what each command does, carry on reading below!
For a complete run of all these commands AND MORE(!!),
consider following the full Bare Bones Bash walkthroughs [here](https://barebonesbash.github.io/#/).

### Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to make you familiar with using bash everyday... 
for the rest of your life! More specifically, we want 
to do this in the context of bioinformatics. We will start with how to navigate 
around a filesystem in the terminal, download sequencing files, and then to
manipulate these. Within these sections we will also show you simple tips and
tricks to make your life generally easier.

This tutorial is designed so you follow along on any machine with a UNIX
terminal (no warranty provided).

### The 5 commandments of Bare Bones Bash

The Bare Bones Bash philosophy of learning to code follows five simple commandments:

|                                                  |                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1)** Be lazy!                                  | Desire for shortcuts motivates you to explore more!            |
| **2)** ~~Google~~ The Hive-Mind knows everything!| 99% of the time, someone else has already had the same issue.  |
| **3)** Document everything you do!               | Make future you happy!                                         |
| **4)** There will ALWAYS be a typo!              | Don't get disheartened, even best programmers make mistakes!   |
| **5)** Don't be afraid of you freedom!           | Explore! Try out things!                                       |

Remember: Noone writes code that works first time, or without looking at StackOverflow sooner or later.

### What is a terminal?

A terminal is simply a fancy window that allows you to access the command-line interface
of a computer or server.

The command-line itself is how you can work on the computer with just text.

`bash` (**b**ourne **a**gain **sh**ell) is one of the most popular languages used in the
terminal.

### Understanding the command prompt

<!-- TODO Add command prompt image here -->

When you open your terminal, it will look something like the image above.
Explain the `$` and the `>`

### Absolute vs Relavtive paths

### Basic commands

### Datastreams, piping, and redirects

### Helptext

### Variables

### Quotes matter!

### find

### For loops

### How to Google like a pro

### (optional) Cleanup

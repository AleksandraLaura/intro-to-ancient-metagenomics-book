## Questions to think about

- What is a metagenome? a microbiota? a microbiome?
- What is ancient metagenomics?
- What challenges do DNA degradation and sample decay pose for ancient metagenomics
- How do you find out “who’s there” in your samples?
- How do alignment based and k-mer based taxonomic profilers differ? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
- Why does database selection matter?
- How do you estimate the preservation and integrity of your ancient metagenome?
- What are tools you can use to identify poorly preserved samples and remove contaminant taxa?
- What aspects of diversity are important in investigating microbial communities?
- Which distance metrics are commonly used to compare the beta-diversity of microbial communities and why? What are some advantages and disadvantages to these different approaches?

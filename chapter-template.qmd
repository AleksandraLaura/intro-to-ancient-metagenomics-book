Around 2015, a technical revolution started when the first programs, e.g. MEGAHIT [@LiMegahit2015] and metaSPAdes [@Nurk2017], were published that could successfully perform *de novo* assembly from metagenomic data. Since then, tens of thousands metagenomic samples have been assembled and it was revealed that even well studied environments, such as the human gut microbiome, have a lot of additional microbial diversity that has not been observed previously via culturing and isolation [@Almeida2021].
